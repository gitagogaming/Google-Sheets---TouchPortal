- Go to https://console.developers.google.com/
1) Create a new project; this can be done in multiple ways but here's one:
2) In the upper left 'Select a project' drop down, open it up and use 'New Project'
3) Give it a name, for example (TP_Sheets-Plugin) and create it
4) In the top-middle search bar, search for 'Google Sheets API', navigate to that and press the 'Enable' button, then go back to your project
   Navigate through 'Credentials' in the left-side menu, click 'Create Credentials' at the top and choose 'API key'

It should display an API key for you to use in the config file.
**It's important to keep this secure**. Whenever sharing configs ensure you remove your apiKey!
You can also 'restrict' that API key by IP address.
This is how you dropdown.
